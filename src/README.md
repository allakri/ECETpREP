# ECET Prep Platform

Welcome to the ECET Prep Platform, a comprehensive, AI-powered web application designed to help students master the Engineering Common Entrance Test (ECET) and achieve their engineering aspirations.

## Our Mission

Our primary motive is to democratize high-quality exam preparation. We aim to provide an accessible, engaging, and effective learning environment that empowers students from all backgrounds. By leveraging modern technology and AI, we want to help students identify their weak areas, clarify their doubts instantly, and build the confidence they need to excel in their examinations.

## How It Works

This application provides a seamless and interactive experience for students preparing for the ECET. The core workflow is as follows:

1.  **Register & Login:** Students create an account with their academic details. This allows for a personalized experience.

2.  **Explore the Roadmap:** New users can visit the "Roadmap" page for a strategic, step-by-step guide on how to prepare for the ECET, from building a foundation to selecting the right college.

3.  **Personalized Profile Hub:** Upon logging in, the user has access to a unified profile page that serves as their personal study hub. It includes:
    *   A **dashboard** to track progress with score history and performance charts.
    *   **Personal Notes** to jot down important concepts.
    *   A **Todo List** to organize study tasks and stay on track.

4.  **Select an Exam:** From the exams page, students can choose from a variety of mock tests tailored to different engineering disciplines (e.g., Computer Science, Electronics, Civil Engineering). They can opt to take a previous year's paper or create a custom test based on specific subjects.

5.  **Take a Mock Test:** The exam interface simulates a real testing environment with a timer, a question palette for easy navigation, and the ability to mark questions for review.

6.  **Get Instant Results & AI Feedback:** Upon submission, students are directed to a comprehensive results page. This includes:
    *   A detailed score breakdown (correct, incorrect, unanswered).
    *   **AI-Powered Adaptive Feedback:** An AI analyzes the student's performance and past scores to provide actionable advice with an adaptive, emotion-aware tone.
    *   **AI Readiness Assessment:** A personalized, encouraging assessment of the student's preparedness for the actual exam.

7.  **Clear Doubts with an AI Tutor:** Students can use the "AI Doubt Solver," a specialized chat interface. This AI tutor is designed to:
    *   Answer questions related to ECET subjects.
    *   Provide explanations for specific exam questions, using the context of the student's recent test.
    *   Politely guide the user back to their studies if they ask off-topic questions, ensuring a focused learning experience.

8. **Engage with the Community:** A dedicated discussion forum allows students to ask questions, share knowledge, and learn collaboratively with their peers.
