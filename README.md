# ECET Prep Platform

Welcome to the ECET Prep Platform, a comprehensive, AI-powered web application designed to help students master the Engineering Common Entrance Test (ECET) and achieve their engineering aspirations.

## Our Mission

Our primary motive is to democratize high-quality exam preparation. We aim to provide an accessible, engaging, and effective learning environment that empowers students from all backgrounds. By leveraging modern technology and AI, we want to help students identify their weak areas, clarify their doubts instantly, and build the confidence they need to excel in their examinations.

## How It Works

This application provides a seamless and interactive experience for students preparing for the ECET. The core workflow is as follows:

1.  **Register & Login:** Students create an account with their academic details. This allows for a personalized experience.

2.  **Personalized Dashboard:** Upon logging in, the user is greeted with a dashboard that tracks their progress, including scores from past tests and a graphical breakdown of their performance.

3.  **Select an Exam:** From the home page, students can choose from a variety of mock tests tailored to different engineering disciplines (e.g., Computer Science, Electronics, Civil Engineering).

4.  **Take a Mock Test:** The exam interface simulates a real testing environment with a timer, a question palette for easy navigation, and the ability to mark questions for review.

5.  **Get Instant Results & AI Feedback:** Upon submission, students are directed to a comprehensive results page. This includes:
    *   A detailed score breakdown (correct, incorrect, unanswered).
    *   **AI-Powered Adaptive Feedback:** An AI analyzes the student's performance to identify weak topics and provide actionable advice for improvement.
    *   **AI Readiness Assessment:** A personalized, encouraging assessment of the student's preparedness for the actual exam.

6.  **Clear Doubts with an AI Tutor:** Students can use the "AI Doubt Solver," a specialized chat interface. This AI tutor is designed to:
    *   Answer questions related to ECET subjects.
    *   Provide explanations for specific exam questions, using the context of the student's recent test.
    *   Politely guide the user back to their studies if they ask off-topic questions, ensuring a focused learning experience.
