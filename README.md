# ECET Prep Platform

Welcome to the ECET Prep Platform, a comprehensive, AI-powered web application designed to help students master the Engineering Common Entrance Test (ECET) and achieve their engineering aspirations. This platform includes a full-featured admin panel for easy management.

## Our Mission

Our primary motive is to democratize high-quality exam preparation. We aim to provide an accessible, engaging, and effective learning environment that empowers students from all backgrounds. By leveraging modern technology and AI, we want to help students identify their weak areas, clarify their doubts instantly, and build the confidence they need to excel in their examinations.

## How It Works

This application provides a seamless and interactive experience for both students and administrators.

### Student Workflow

1.  **Register & Login:** Students create an account with their academic details for a personalized experience. The login and registration process is secure and includes password visibility toggles and a "Forgot Password" flow. The user session persists across page reloads.
2.  **Unified Profile Hub:** Upon logging in, the user has access to a central profile page that includes a dashboard for progress tracking, personal notes, and a todo list to organize study tasks. All data is saved in the browser's local storage for persistence.
3.  **Explore the Roadmap:** A strategic guide on the "Roadmap" page walks students through their entire preparation journey.
4.  **Take Mock Tests:** Students can select from a wide range of mock tests, including previous years' papers and custom tests based on specific subjects. The exam interface simulates a real testing environment.
5.  **Get AI-Powered Results:** After submitting an exam, students receive a detailed results page with their score, a breakdown of answers, and AI-generated adaptive feedback and readiness assessment.
6.  **AI Doubt Solver:** A specialized chat interface allows students to get 24/7 help with ECET-related questions from an AI tutor.
7.  **Community Engagement:** A discussion forum provides a space for students to collaborate and learn from their peers.

### Admin Workflow

1.  **Secure Login:** Administrators log in to access a dedicated admin panel.
2.  **Dashboard Overview:** The admin dashboard provides at-a-glance statistics, such as total users, tests taken, and active discussions.
3.  **Manage Test Series:** Admins can upload new test questions via JSON files and view existing test data.
4.  **Post Announcements:** An interface to create and post platform-wide announcements for all users.
5.  **View Users:** A list of recently joined users can be monitored from the dashboard.
